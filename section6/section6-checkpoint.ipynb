A trend analysis is done by taking each line item in all three statements and calculating the percent change from period to period. Then, I will use the \"overview\" data to perform a financial ratio analysis to compare Apple and Microsoft. Once that is done, I will analyze the data to look for possible trends, major differences, and overall financial health of each company to decide which one is better suited for long-term investment. For the trend analysis, I will build a DataFrame for each financial statement and then calculate the percent change within them. For the financial ratio analysis, I will create one DataFrame with Microsoft and Apples financial ratios side by side to to make a direct comparison of the two companies.  "
